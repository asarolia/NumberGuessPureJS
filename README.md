Sample JS project to play guess the number game - 

Game should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 5 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong â€” and, if they are wrong, indicate whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.
